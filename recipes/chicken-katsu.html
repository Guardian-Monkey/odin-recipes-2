    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Chicken katsu is Japanese-style fried chicken. It also be used to make tonkatsu by
        using pork cutlets instead of chicken. Serve with white rice and tonkatsu sauce.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>four skinless, boneless chicken breast halves</li>
        <li>simply seasoned with salt and pepper</li>
        <li>All-purpose flour; helps seal in the moisture, adds flavor, and promotes browning.</li>
        <li>Panko; Panko bread crumbs are responsible for katsu's signature crunch.</li>
        <li>An egg; adds moisture and gives the Panko something to stick to.</li>
        <li>Oil; Opt for a neutral oil with a high smoke point, such as canola or vegetable oil.</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Season chicken breasts on both sides with salt and pepper. Place flour, beaten egg, and panko crumbs into
            separate shallow dishes. Coat chicken breasts in flour, shaking off any excess; dip into egg, and then press
            into panko crumbs until well coated on both sides.</li>
        <li>Heat oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Place chicken in the hot oil, and fry until golden brown,
            3 or 4 minutes per side. Transfer to a paper towel-lined plate to drain.</li>
    </ol>
