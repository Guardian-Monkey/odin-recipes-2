    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Quick, easy, and tasty macaroni and cheese dish. Fancy, designer mac and cheese often costs forty or fifty
        dollars to prepare when you have so many expensive cheeses, but they aren't always the best tasting. This simple
        recipe is cheap and tasty.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>8 ounces of elbow macaroni</li>
        <li>1/4 cup butter</li>
        <li>1/4 cup all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>ground black pepper to taste</li>
        <li>2 cups milk</li>
        <li>2 cups shredded cheddar cheese</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook elbow macaroni in the boiling water, stirring
            occasionally until cooked through but firm to the bite, 8 minutes.</li>
        <li>At the same time, melt butter in a saucepan over medium heat.</li>
        <li>Add flour, salt, and pepper and stir until smooth, about 5 minutes.</li>
        <li>Pour in milk slowly, while stirring continuously. Continue to cook and stir until mixture is smooth and
            bubbling, about 5 minutes, making sure the milk doesn't burn.</li>
        <li>Add Cheddar cheese and stir until melted, 2 to 4 minutes.</li>
        <li>Drain macaroni and fold into cheese sauce until coated.</li>
        <li>Serve hot and enjoy!</li>
    </ol>
