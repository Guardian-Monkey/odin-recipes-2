# odin-recipes-2
Reflection:
This process of coming back to the odin-recipes project and creating everything from
the ground up again has been very educational. I feel that I've relearned the power of
the command line (when I had to move downloaded images from the web into the images directory), gotten accustomed to the git workflow, and have committed to memory the various elements and tags that we've learned to use in The Odin Project.
